# Chapter 4: Currying

## Can't live if livin' is without you
My Dad once explained how there are certain things one can live without until one acquires them. A microwave is one such thing. Smart phones, another. The older folks among us will remember a fulfilling life sans internet. For me, currying is on this list.

The concept is simple: You can call a function with fewer arguments than it expects. It returns a function that takes the remaining arguments.

You can choose to call it all at once or simply feed in each argument piecemeal.

```js
var add = function(x) {
  return function(y) {
    return x + y;
  };
};

var increment = add(1);
var addTen = add(10);

increment(2);
// 3

addTen(2);
// 12
```

Here we've made a function `add` that takes one argument and return a function. By calling it, the returned function remembers the first argument from then on via the closure. Calling it with both arguments all at once is a bit of a pain, however, so we can use a special helper function called `curry` to make defining and calling functions like this easier.

Let's setup a few curried functions for our enjoyment.

```js
var curry = require('lodash.curry');

var match = curry(function(what, str) {
  return str.match(what);
});

var replace = curry(function(what, replacement, str) {
  return str.replace(what, replacement);
});

var filter = curry(function(f, ary) {
  return ary.filter(f);
});

var map = curry(function(f, ary) {
  return ary.map(f);
});
```

The pattern I've followed is a simple, but important one. I've strategically positioned the data we're operating on (String, Array) as the last argument. It will become clear as to why upon use.

```js
match(/\s+/g, "hello world");
// [ ' ' ]

match(/\s+/g)("hello world");
// [ ' ' ]

var hasSpaces = match(/\s+/g);
// function(x) { return x.match(/\s+/g) }

hasSpaces("hello world");
// [ ' ' ]

hasSpaces("spaceless");
// null

filter(hasSpaces, ["tori_spelling", "tori amos"]);
// ["tori amos"]

var findSpaces = filter(hasSpaces);
// function(xs) { return xs.filter(function(x) { return x.match(/\s+/g) }) }

findSpaces(["tori_spelling", "tori amos"]);
// ["tori amos"]

var noVowels = replace(/[aeiou]/ig);
// function(replacement, x) { return x.replace(/[aeiou]/ig, replacement) }

var censored = noVowels("*");
// function(x) { return x.replace(/[aeiou]/ig, "*") }

censored("Chocolate Rain");
// 'Ch*c*l*t* R**n'
```

What's demonstrated here is the ability to "pre-load" a function with an argument or two in order to receive a new function that remembers those arguments.

I encourage you to `npm install lodash`, copy the code above and have a go at it in the repl. You can also do this in a browser where lodash or ramda is available.

## More than a pun / special sauce

Currying is useful for many things. We can make new functions just by giving our base functions some arguments as seen in `hasSpaces`, `findSpaces`, and `censored`.

We also have the ability to transform any function that works on single elements into a function that works on arrays simply by wrapping it with `map`:

```js
var getChildren = function(x) {
  return x.childNodes;
};

var allTheChildren = map(getChildren);
```

Giving a function fewer arguments than it expects is typically called *partial application*. Partially applying a function can remove a lot of boiler plate code. Consider what the above `allTheChildren` function would be with the uncurried `map` from lodash[^note the arguments are in a different order]:

```js
var allTheChildren = function(elements) {
  return _.map(elements, getChildren);
};
```

We typically don't define functions that work on arrays, because we can just call `map(getChildren)` inline. Same with `sort`, `filter`, and other higher order functions[^Higher order function: A function that takes or returns a function].

When we spoke about *pure functions*, we said they take 1 input to 1 output. Currying does exactly this: each single argument returns a new function expecting the remaining arguments. That, old sport, is 1 input to 1 output.

No matter if the output is another function - it qualifies as pure. We do allow more than one argument at a time, but this is seen as merely removing the extra `()`'s for convenience.


## In summary

Currying is handy and I very much enjoy working with curried functions on a daily basis. It is a tool for the belt that makes functional programming less verbose and tedious.

We can make new, useful functions on the fly simply by passing in a few arguments and as a bonus, we've retained the mathematical function definition despite multiple arguments.

Let's acquire another essential tool called `compose`.

## Exercises

A quick word before we start. We'll use a library called *ramda* which curries every function by default. Alternatively you may choose to use *lodash-fp* which does the same and is written/maintained by the creator of lodash. Both will work just fine and it is a matter of preference.

[lodash-fp](https://github.com/lodash/lodash-fp)

There are [unit tests](https://github.com/DrBoolean/mostly-adequate-guide/tree/master/code/part1_exercises) to run against your exercises as you code them, or you can just copy-paste into a javascript REPL for the early exercises if you wish.

Answers are provided with the code in the [repository for this book](https://github.com/DrBoolean/mostly-adequate-guide/tree/master/code/part1_exercises/answers)

```js
var _ = require('ramda');


// Exercise 1
//==============
// Refactor to remove all arguments by partially applying the function

var words = function(str) {
  return _.split(' ', str);
};

// Exercise 1a
//==============
// Use map to make a new words fn that works on an array of strings.

var sentences = undefined;


// Exercise 2
//==============
// Refactor to remove all arguments by partially applying the functions

var filterQs = function(xs) {
  return _.filter(function(x){ return match(/q/i, x);  }, xs);
};


// Exercise 3
//==============
// Use the helper function _keepHighest to refactor max to not reference any
// arguments

// LEAVE BE:
var _keepHighest = function(x,y){ return x >= y ? x : y; };

// REFACTOR THIS ONE:
var max = function(xs) {
  return _.reduce(function(acc, x){
    return _keepHighest(acc, x);
  }, -Infinity, xs);
};


// Bonus 1:
// ============
// wrap array's slice to be functional and curried.
// //[1,2,3].slice(0, 2)
var slice = undefined;


// Bonus 2:
// ============
// use slice to define a function "take" that takes n elements from the beginning of the string. Make it curried
// // Result for "Something" with n=4 should be "Some"
var take = undefined;
```
